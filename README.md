# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
## Introduction
I created this repository while I was practising problems in data structures and algorithms. Primary reason for this to document my progress and also chalk out 
my thought patterns as I was imporving my coding skills. I mostly followed 'Data Structres and Algorithms' syllabus of 'GeeksforGeeks'. 

## Structure 
Its overall sequencing mataches that of 'Geeksforgeeks' sequence of DSA. Alongside each problem, I have included my own thoughts and ideas. Mistakes that I committed and what I learned from them. I hope that this collection would be useful for anyone learning to code at any stage in their career.
